> [!WARNING]
> Rabbit-Proxy is still currently under development and is not yet ready for production use, as of now there is only a CLI that is interactive and can be used to start a proxy server and intercept requests and responses. GUI/Web UI is still under consideration but it will be developed using other tools and technologies.
